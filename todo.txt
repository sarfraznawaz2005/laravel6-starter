theme issues
remove bootstrap 4 for admin and use app.css instead
php artisan vendor:publish --all --force
api_token confirm from docs
check all packages are working
https://github.com/eusonlito/laravel-Meta
publish migrate rundev, optimize, etc toolbar

vendor cleanup command too slow
npm outdated
composer outdated

- https://github.com/pqina/filepond
- verify all configs and their options are used and that they are working fine
- php artisan vendor:publish --all --force and adjust new settings by packages by comparing with git
- compare changes in defaults in .env, composer.json, app.js, bootstrap.js, default framework config files, etc

ISSUES:
--------------------------------------
- validate forms plugin does not show red borders - in the mean time, i added css for red borders in loader.css file.
