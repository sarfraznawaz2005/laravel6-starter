npm outdated
composer outdated

- verify all configs and their options are used and that they are working fine
- php artisan vendor:publish --all --force and adjust new settings by packages by comparing with git
- compare changes in defaults in .env, composer.json, app.js, bootstrap.js, default framework config files, etc
- check all packages are working

ISSUES:
--------------------------------------
- vendor cleanup command too slow
- validate forms plugin does not show red borders - in the mean time, i added css for red borders in loader.css file.
